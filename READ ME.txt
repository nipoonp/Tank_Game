First start up eclipse on both computers (client and server) and follow the tutorial given if not sure how to import project into eclipse.
Import only the JAVA CODES, Python may be used in a text editor to run.


THEN go on the CLIENT PYTHON CODE and change IP addresses.

Firstly, go on line 38 and type in YOUR IP address.(ie the slave IP address)
Next, go on line 629 and replce ip with YOUR IP (ie the slave IP address)
GO to line 707 and type in the other computers IP address (ie the master ip address)
GO to line 755 and replace IP with other computers IP address (ie the master ip address)
GO to line 839 and replace IP with other computers IP address (ie the master ip address)
YOU may keep the ports the same, or choose to change them.

The master python code should not need to do any altering, as it get the IP adress of master and slave automatically.


STEPS:
Now first run the master python code, log in
next run slave python code, log in
from master send challenge to slave
make slave accept challenge, from view challenges
make slave open up java slave game
now make master open up java master game
